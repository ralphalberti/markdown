# Lists

In this chapter, we will focus on the different types of lists in the Markdown language.

## Ordered Lists

1. Ralph
2. Mark
3. Peter

## Unordered Lists

- Bananas
- Strawberries
- Chicken
- Shallots
- Peas

## Task Lists

- [ ] Learn Everything about git
- [ ] Lean how to use git along with GitHub
- [ ] Fork Kickstart.nvim
- [ ] Clone Kickstart.nvim
- [ ] Make changes to my Kickstart and keep track of them with git and GitHub

Even though this is only me testing git and GitHub, this is the coolest
I can see that nvim is working nicely
I see that my "lists" branch is reported in the status line below
I wonder what happens to the + signs in the gutter after I save and commit this update to GitHub?
